eCommerce Sales Data Analysis
This project provides insights into eCommerce sales data by analyzing customer behavior, revenue trends, and product performance using SQL and Python. The analysis and visualizations are conducted in Jupyter Notebook, connecting to a MySQL database for efficient data handling and exploration.

📁 Project Structure
Data Files: Raw data files (in XLS format) for customers, orders, products, payments, etc.
Resources: Contains any additional materials and references used in the project.
SQL Queries: Organized into three levels:
Basic: Foundational insights, such as unique customer locations and total sales per category.
Intermediate: Monthly order volumes, revenue contributions by category, and correlation analyses.
Advanced: Cumulative sales, customer retention, and year-over-year growth metrics.

🚀 Key Features
Data Analysis: SQL queries to extract valuable insights, including customer retention rates, top-spending customers, and moving average order values.
Database Integration: Connected MySQL database to Python via MySQL Connector for seamless data extraction.
Data Visualization: Used Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to visualize key trends and revenue distributions.

📊 Tech Stack
Languages & Tools: SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Database: MySQL (connected using MySQL Connector)
